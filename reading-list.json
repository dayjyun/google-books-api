Set on the Colorado high plains, the town of Lions is nearly deserted. Built to be a glorious city, it was never fit for farming, mining, trading, or any of the industries its pioneers imagined. The Walkers have been settled on its barren terrain for generations—a simple family in a town still enthralled by promises of bigger, better, and brighter. But when a stranger appears, his unsettling presence sets off a chain reaction that will change the fates of everyone he encounters. When the patriarch John Walker dies, his son Gordon must choose between leaving for college with his girlfriend, Leigh, or staying with his family to look after their failing welding shop—and carry on a mysterious family legacy. While Leigh is desperate to make a better life in the world beyond Lions, Gordon is strangely hesitant to leave it behind. And as more families abandon the town, it seems that listening to reason must come at the cost of betraying his own heart. “Nadzam weaves a strange and mesmerizing story” that explores ambition and an American obsession with self-improvement, the responsibilities we have to ourselves and each other, as well as the everyday illusions that pass for a life worth living (Publishers Weekly).","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780802189912"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0802189911"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":true},"pageCount":288,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":33,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.9.8.0.preview.3","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oQJeCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oQJeCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oQJeCwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=Lions&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oQJeCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oQJeCwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":17.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":17.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oQJeCwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-oQJeCwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":17990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":17990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Lions-sample-epub.acsm?id=oQJeCwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Lions-sample-pdf.acsm?id=oQJeCwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=oQJeCwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Set on the Colorado high plains, the town of Lions is nearly deserted.

A spectacular 7,000-year-old engraving in Libya depicts a catfight. Figures modeled by the Babylonians remind us of their belief that the souls of priests were escorted to paradise by a helpful cat. Pablo Picasso was known to have loved cats and famously portrayed them as savage predators. In Victorian times, cats were depicted in loving family groups with mothers caring for their playful kittens. Today, the cat is one of the most popular domestic pets on the planet, and feline art is a hugely popular theme across the world. In his latest eye-catching book, best-selling author Desmond Morris tells the compelling story of cats in art. He explores feline art in its many forms, tracing its history from ancient rock paintings and spectacular Egyptian art to the work of old masters, avant-garde representations, and the depiction of cats in cartoons. Morris discusses the various ways in which artists have approached the subject throughout history, weaving illuminating stories with rarely seen images. The result is a beautifully illustrated book that will delight anyone with a Kitty, Max, or Tigger in their life.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1780238339"},{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781780238333"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":248,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Cats"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"preview-1.0.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ExinAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ExinAQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ExinAQAACAAJ&dq=cats&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ExinAQAACAAJ&dq=cats&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Cats_in_Art.html?hl=&id=ExinAQAACAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ExinAQAACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Today, the cat is one of the most popular domestic pets on the planet, and feline art is a hugely popular theme across the world.
